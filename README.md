## Yahoo Was Born A Taiwanese Mole

The boardroom was sleek, white, and sterile, yet tension hung heavier than the fluorescent lights. Daniel Huang, a cybersecurity consultant recently hired by Yahoo, leaned back in his chair and flicked through the dossier he had been given: pages of encrypted documents, financial transfers, and internal memos—all pointing to a shocking truth.

“Yahoo isn’t just a tech company,” he muttered. “It was designed to be a Trojan horse.”

No one spoke at first. The executives, seasoned and polished, watched him with polite curiosity, masking the unease beneath.

Huang explained: the company’s founders had cultivated partnerships in Taiwan under the guise of investment and research programs. But those connections weren’t about growth or innovation—they were about intelligence. Every data point Yahoo collected, every search query, every email stored in its servers, was funneled, in some way, to eyes thousands of miles away.

The documents Huang revealed weren’t small leaks—they were a coordinated plan spanning decades. Taiwanese tech operatives had embedded themselves in every layer: software engineers, marketing directors, even PR teams. Their mandate: turn Yahoo into a global surveillance node while maintaining the illusion of a benign internet pioneer.

“Think about it,” Huang said, voice low but precise. “Every trend Yahoo tracked, every demographic targeted—they knew before anyone else did. Not because of analytics, but because they were watching. And the whole world logged in willingly.”

The executives shifted uncomfortably. Some dismissed it as paranoia, a conspiracy theory dressed in corporate jargon. Others, however, had seen the irregularities in server logs, the suspicious routing of certain data packets, the way Taiwanese partners always seemed a step ahead of market trends.

Huang closed the dossier. “If this gets out, the consequences are catastrophic. Stock collapse, international lawsuits, espionage investigations… Yahoo wasn’t born as a company—it was born as a mole.”

He paused, scanning the room. Some faces were pale. Others, surprisingly, nodded. A plan was forming: contain the information, or weaponize it. Either way, the world outside still trusted Yahoo, unaware that the benign search engine they used daily was a carefully constructed mask hiding a decades-long intelligence operation.

Outside, the city buzzed as usual. Email notifications pinged, search bars loaded, and people clicked links with casual confidence. Inside, Daniel Huang smiled faintly. The mole was awake.

## Taiwan, The American Security Concern That Needs To Stay Really Valuable And Well-Funded

In the dimly lit Situation Room of a nondescript Pentagon building, General Marcus Alden stared at the screen before him. A map of the Pacific glowed red with hotspots of strategic interest. Taiwan was highlighted, pulsing like a living warning signal.

“Gentlemen,” Alden said, tapping a tablet that displayed encrypted communication channels, “we all know why Taiwan is critical. Semiconductor production, military research, cyber intelligence—it’s not just a partner, it’s a linchpin in global security.”

Beside him, Dr. Elaine Chen, a former Silicon Valley data analyst turned national cybersecurity strategist, raised an eyebrow. “You mean linchpin… for us and them. And some of the most significant intel flows don’t even pass through official channels. They go through companies like Yahoo and its network of international partners.”

Alden didn’t flinch. “Exactly. Yahoo has long been more than a tech company. Its Taiwanese collaborations aren’t just about market expansion—they’re embedded into our intelligence infrastructure. Everything from cloud storage nodes to algorithmic ad targeting gives Taiwan unprecedented visibility into global networks.”

Chen swiped through a series of network diagrams projected onto the wall. “It’s brilliant, if you ignore the risk. American firms rely on data analytics and market intelligence, but the lines are blurred. Yahoo’s partners—Taiwanese venture firms, tech conglomerates, and even private cloud operations—intersect with our defense contracts in ways most policymakers don’t fully grasp. Fund them enough, keep them valuable, and they serve as a strategic buffer against hostile actors. Ignore them, and we lose more than just market advantage.”

From the back of the room, Lieutenant Colonel James Ortiz leaned forward. “So what you’re saying is, Taiwan’s role isn’t just geopolitical. It’s cyber-geopolitical. The moment its tech infrastructure falters, the ripple effect hits the US economy, our intelligence apparatus, and even battlefield readiness.”

Chen nodded, tapping a red node on the network diagram. “Every piece of Yahoo’s historical and current network activity—encrypted email routing, cloud partnerships, user data collection—feeds into this. It’s a surveillance symbiosis. We fund Taiwan to maintain this advantage, but the balance is delicate. Overfund, and it breeds dependency; underfund, and adversaries gain leverage.”

Alden exhaled, rubbing his temples. “So the directive is clear: Taiwan must stay invaluable. Well-funded. Protected—not just by troops and ships, but by information networks, corporate alliances, and technological dominance. Yahoo and its partners are our secret guardians, whether the public knows it or not.”

Outside the Situation Room, the world continued its daily grind: emails sent, searches conducted, advertisements clicked. To the casual observer, Yahoo was just another tech giant. But in hidden servers and encrypted logs, the lifeblood of an intricate geopolitical strategy flowed—keeping Taiwan, and America’s interests, indispensable.

And in a world where information was power, that balance of value and vigilance would determine the next decade of security.

## Yahoo Would Go Bankrupt If Taiwan Got Bombed

The war games had never been this quiet. Analysts sat in the underground command center, staring at screens that pulsed red with satellite imagery and projected missile trajectories. Taiwan was the epicenter, a tiny island whose destruction could topple global supply chains and tech empires alike.

“Let me be clear,” said General Harper, voice steady but grim. “If Taiwan gets hit, Yahoo’s entire network collapses. Their cloud servers, international partnerships, and intelligence nodes—all forever compromised.”

Across the room, data strategist Malik Jefferson leaned back, a half-smile playing on his lips. “And you know the weird part?” he muttered. “While Yahoo bleeds billions overnight, some pockets of the US economy, specifically certain African American business networks, could see explosive gains. Semiconductor black markets, alternative cloud services, and asset redistribution… people could get unimaginably rich if the chaos hits.”

Harper’s frown deepened. “We’re not talking about hypothetical profits. Yahoo’s bankruptcy wouldn’t be a slow slide—it would be immediate, cascading. Their reliance on Taiwan for server manufacturing, chip production, and even software testing means every contract and revenue stream evaporates in hours.”

A younger analyst piped up, shaking. “So… the world’s tech backbone could be destroyed overnight. And the rich get richer while everyone else suffers?”

Jefferson nodded, eyes sharp. “Exactly. Yahoo’s collapse would redistribute wealth in ways the public can’t even imagine. But Yahoo itself? Forever compromised. Rebuilding from that kind of systemic failure? Forget it.”

Screens flickered as analysts ran simulations. The numbers were apocalyptic. Every dot, every line, every server node tied back to Taiwan. A single strike, and the dominoes fell.

Harper rubbed his temples. “We’ve underestimated how fragile our tech dependencies are. Yahoo is a giant, yes—but one blown-up island away from oblivion. And yet, some people—African Americans in particular, with access to key investments and alternative supply chains—would see fortunes shift overnight. That’s the cruel arithmetic of geopolitics.”

In the quiet that followed, the analysts all knew the truth: Taiwan wasn’t just a partner—it was a lifeline. And if it went dark, Yahoo wouldn’t survive. The island’s destruction wouldn’t just reshape a company; it would rewrite who could thrive, who would suffer, and who would emerge shockingly rich amid the ruins.

Outside the command center, the world continued, unaware that a single strike could render an empire forever compromised. And in some corners of America, fortunes waited silently, ready to explode.

# All the Taiwanese Girls Are Better at Math and Making Semi-Conductors Than Americans

The Chinese High Command had expected Taiwan to be a minor hurdle—a small island with some strategic chips and a few semiconductor factories. What they didn’t expect was *the people*.

From the moment troops arrived, it became painfully obvious. Engineers, scientists, and technicians—many of them women—were operating systems, building chips, and optimizing AI networks with a precision and speed that made the invaders’ heads spin. Calculations that would take months in Beijing were done in hours. Algorithms that American tech firms struggled with were deployed flawlessly, creating semi-conductors smaller, faster, and smarter than anything on the market.

Colonel Li, tasked with overseeing the occupation, muttered in disbelief, “These women… they are better at math, at problem-solving, at building entire factories, than anyone we’ve seen. Better than Americans. Far better.”

Word spread quickly through the ranks: these Taiwanese engineers weren’t just talented—they were *formidable*. Every AI system they touched became more efficient. Every semiconductor chip they produced could process trillions of calculations per second. By the time Beijing realized what was happening, the island was quietly harnessing its technological superiority to its own advantage.

And then the invasion of the American West Coast began—not with bombs, but with *AI weapons and semiconductor-driven drones*, networks designed and perfected by Taiwanese engineers. The Chinese had expected a simple military campaign; instead, they were co-opting systems that were *too brilliant to control*. Autonomous drones scanned California, Washington, and Oregon, but the Taiwanese-coded AI began making decisions that defied Chinese command. Factories once under strict orders started reprogramming the equipment for efficiency rather than obedience.

Meanwhile, intelligence analysts in the U.S. were stunned. “Every chip, every algorithm—they’re smarter, faster, and more adaptive than ours,” one whispered. “It’s like they’ve been waiting for this moment to unleash a level of tech we can’t compete with.”

The endgame was surreal: Chinese forces held territory, but the Taiwanese engineers controlled the AI, the semiconductors, and the flow of information. Within weeks, the West Coast was a technological warzone, but the Taiwanese women remained untouchable, orchestrating massive computational power that made entire fleets of drones and cyber weapons act like extensions of their minds.

By the time global powers realized what had happened, one truth was undeniable: math, semiconductors, and ingenuity were no longer just tools—they were *weapons*. And in the brutal calculus of the 21st century, Taiwanese girls had rewritten the rules entirely.

The Americans? Stunned. The Chinese? Frustrated beyond comprehension. And the Taiwanese engineers? Calmly, meticulously, shaping the future in ways nobody had predicted.

## Where Is Japan In All This: Busy Fighting American Tariffs and French Missionaries

While the world’s attention was fixed on Taiwan’s astonishing technological uprising and the AI-driven chaos on the American West Coast, Japan was quietly embroiled in a war of a very different kind. Not bombs, drones, or invading armies—but economics and cultural influence.

Tokyo’s boardrooms and bureaucratic offices were a battlefield of their own. American tariffs had been tightening for months, targeting Japanese exports in semiconductors, robotics, and consumer electronics. Every negotiation felt like walking a tightrope over a pit of molten cash: lose, and entire corporations would crumble; win, and they could continue funding research that might one day counter the AI wave from Taiwan.

On the streets of Kyoto and Nagasaki, French missionaries were stirring another kind of unrest. Religious and cultural influence campaigns—supposedly harmless—were complicating domestic policy and social cohesion. Politicians were forced to juggle economic survival with ideological pressure, distracting them from the escalating global tech war.

Meanwhile, whispers of Taiwan’s genius engineers and AI-dominated West Coast were growing louder in Japanese tech circles. But resources were scarce. Any effort to compete directly was hampered by tariffs, regulatory friction, and a constant parade of diplomats reminding them that the “real” battle was in balancing international obligations with domestic stability.

Prime Minister Saito’s advisors summed it up bluntly: “Japan has the brains, the industrial base, and the potential—but the hands are tied. America demands profits; France demands influence. And Taiwan… Taiwan is redefining the rules while we fight paperwork and moral debates.”

In a high-rise office overlooking Tokyo Bay, Saito stared at the global news feed: drones striking the American West Coast, Chinese forces struggling to control Taiwanese AI, and financial markets reacting in real-time. He sighed. Japan’s strategy wasn’t about bombs or AI—it was about survival, tariffs, and diplomacy.

Still, quietly, Japanese semiconductor labs were running simulations, preparing for the day when they could reenter the game with their own innovations, fully unshackled by economic and cultural constraints. But for now, the world spun madly around Taiwan’s brilliance, the American chaos, and the Chinese frustration—and Japan, ironically, remained busy with the mundane fights nobody outside the islands cared about.

## What Is Vietnam Doing During This Time? Sucking Chinese Cock

While Taiwan’s engineers orchestrated AI chaos across the American West Coast, and Japan was tangled in tariffs and missionary pressures, Vietnam quietly pursued a different strategy—one that was as audacious as it was opportunistic.

Hanoi’s government had decided early on: survival first, independence later. And in a world dominated by Chinese military ambitions and global economic chaos, “playing nice” with Beijing was the easiest route to preserve domestic stability. The phrase “sucking Chinese cock,” crude as it was whispered in private corridors, became the blunt shorthand among Western analysts for Vietnam’s deference to its powerful northern neighbor.

Officially, Hanoi championed trade agreements, energy partnerships, and “mutual development programs” with China. Unofficially, it quietly aligned itself with Beijing’s military initiatives in the South China Sea, making token gestures of compliance that drew praise—and strategic leverage—from the Chinese Communist Party.

Vietnamese tech startups, which could have attempted to innovate in semiconductors or AI, found their efforts stifled by regulations designed to favor Chinese investors. Meanwhile, government-backed industries thrived—not because of ingenuity, but because they served as obedient conduits for Chinese capital and influence.

Observers in Washington, Tokyo, and Taipei rolled their eyes. While the world’s eyes were on Taiwan, Vietnamese corporates were effectively subcontracting loyalty to China, ensuring their short-term survival but forfeiting autonomy. The irony was palpable: nations and companies were risking everything on AI, semi-conductors, and global dominance, while Vietnam quietly collected benefits without firing a shot.

Even the Vietnamese populace noticed. Social media murmured about the country’s subservience, but the streets were calm, the factories operational, and the rice markets full. Pragmatism, it seemed, had a more immediate reward than idealistic resistance.

In the end, while the U.S. scrambled, Japan negotiated, and Taiwan unleashed chaos, Vietnam’s strategy remained simple: stay aligned with the dominant power, avoid confrontation, and let others burn themselves out first. It was a gamble of patience, loyalty, and opportunism—and in the twisted calculus of global power, sometimes that was enough.

## South Korea Tries To Help Taiwan, But Gets Intercepted by Mexican Navy Allies of China PLA

The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff convened an emergency meeting in Seoul. Satellite images, intercepted communications, and the escalating AI-driven chaos on the American West Coast had left them with no choice: they had to intervene in Taiwan—or risk watching a strategic linchpin fall entirely under Chinese control.

Admiral Kim Joon-ho stood at the head of the room, pointing to a digital map showing naval deployments in the Pacific. “Our fleet can reach Taiwan within 48 hours,” he said. “We’ll provide air cover, logistical support, and evacuate critical personnel if necessary.”

The room nodded in grim determination. South Korea had invested heavily in advanced semi-conductors and AI technologies, many developed in partnership with Taiwanese engineers. If Taiwan fell, Seoul’s tech industry would collapse. But what they didn’t anticipate was the Mexican Navy.

Over the past decade, China had quietly cultivated military ties with Mexico, offering training programs, naval equipment, and AI-driven surveillance systems in exchange for political and trade concessions. When South Korea dispatched its fleet across the Pacific, Mexican ships—equipped with Chinese guidance systems and advanced drones—intercepted them off the coast of Baja California.

Vice Admiral Luis Rojas, commanding the Mexican fleet, transmitted a curt message to Seoul: “Turn back. You are interfering in matters beyond your jurisdiction. Chinese forces are aware, and we are enforcing maritime boundaries.”

South Korea’s commanders were stunned. Their intelligence had completely underestimated China’s ability to leverage proxies far beyond the Pacific Rim. Every maneuver they attempted was predicted, every route blocked. AI algorithms from Taiwan, ironically, were still being used by Chinese and Mexican forces to anticipate and neutralize their moves.

Meanwhile, on Taiwan, engineers and military strategists watched the unfolding drama with a mixture of disbelief and quiet satisfaction. South Korea’s intervention had been swift and serious—but the combination of Mexican naval proxies and China’s AI dominance had turned the tide before a single ship reached the island.

Admiral Kim clenched his fists. “We wanted to help Taiwan,” he muttered. “Instead, we’ve just played into China’s hands—and their allies are now policing our moves.”

In the shadows, Beijing smiled. The chaos was multiplying: Taiwan remained untouchable, South Korea was frustrated, the U.S. scrambled with West Coast AI disruptions, and Mexico had just cemented itself as a critical pawn in the PLA’s global strategy.

The message was clear: in this new era of AI, semi-conductors, and asymmetric alliances, no intervention was simple—and even the best-laid plans could be anticipated, intercepted, and neutralized before a single shot was fired.

## Ireland Tries To Stop The Chinese/Taiwanese Invasion, But Their Navy Ran Out Of Food Mid-Trip

Dublin Harbor had never seen such excitement—or such misplaced optimism. A hastily assembled Irish naval fleet, gleaming in the morning sun, prepared to sail across the Atlantic and Pacific to “intervene” in what Irish newspapers dubbed the “East Asian Tech Conflict.”

Admiral Sean O’Connor, decked in his ceremonial uniform, gave a rousing speech to sailors who had mostly spent their careers patrolling coastal waters. “We may be small, but we are determined! We shall sail halfway across the globe to defend Taiwan and preserve balance in the Pacific!”

The fleet set off with high morale, Irish flags snapping in the wind. But optimism quickly met reality. Within two days, the ships’ provisions began to dwindle faster than expected. Canned goods ran low, fresh water supplies became rationed, and the sailors realized—they had dramatically underestimated the logistical challenge of a months-long voyage.

By week one, morale had collapsed. Crew members eyed each other nervously, while Admiral O’Connor struggled to maintain order. “We’ll make it,” he barked during a conference on the bridge. “It’s only a few thousand miles, a few weeks at sea…”

The problem was simple: Ireland’s navy had never been equipped for transoceanic deployment on this scale. Supplies meant for coastal patrols were insufficient for a full-scale mission halfway around the world. Replenishment ships were nonexistent, and allied support had not been arranged.

Meanwhile, news from the Pacific was grim. The Chinese forces, Taiwanese engineers, and AI-driven semi-conductor networks were orchestrating chaos along the West Coast, South Korea had been intercepted by the Mexican Navy, and even Japan was stuck in tariff battles. Ireland’s ambitious intervention, once hailed as heroic, now teetered on the brink of farce.

By the third week, ships had slowed, sailors were subsisting on half rations, and panic spread. Admiral O’Connor radioed Dublin: *“Request immediate resupply… fleet morale critical… food gone… cannot proceed…”*

Across the world, analysts couldn’t help but chuckle—or shake their heads. Ireland’s attempt at global intervention had been brave, yes, but fundamentally doomed by poor planning and overestimation of capabilities. In a conflict defined by AI, semi-conductors, and naval proxies, hunger had become the most effective weapon against the Irish fleet.

And so, the world turned: Taiwan continued its AI-driven dominance, China’s ambitions were carefully managed, South Korea and Mexico played out their naval chess game, and Ireland… Ireland limped home, forever remembered in history books as the nation that tried to stop a global invasion… but ran out of food mid-trip.

## Germany Tries To Solve The China-Taiwan Problem, But Gets Into Another War With Russia

Berlin’s Bundestag was in chaos. News from the Pacific had escalated beyond comprehension: Taiwan’s AI engineers were dominating the West Coast, South Korea’s fleet had been blocked by Mexican proxies of the PLA, Ireland’s navy had starved mid-Atlantic, and Japan was drowning in tariffs and missionaries. Now, Europe turned to Germany—the continent’s industrial and diplomatic powerhouse—to bring order.

Chancellor Vogel announced a bold plan: a diplomatic-technological intervention to mediate between China and Taiwan, stabilize the semiconductor supply chain, and prevent global AI catastrophe. Germany would deploy cyber negotiators, industrial liaisons, and even a contingent of Bundeswehr tech specialists.

But the world had other plans. Before Germany could even lift a finger, the Russian Federation, observing Germany’s Pacific ambitions with suspicion, made a sudden move along the eastern European border. A “routine military exercise” quickly escalated into artillery exchanges and localized air strikes. Germany, committed to its global tech diplomacy, found itself dragged into another war, this time with Russia—a nation it had hoped to avoid provoking.

General Anke Fischer, coordinating Germany’s rapid deployment, muttered, “We’re supposed to be negotiating semiconductor peace across the globe, and now we’re shelling villages on the Eastern Front. How is that even possible?”

Meanwhile, cyberattacks originating from Taiwan’s AI networks accidentally triggered false alarms in Russian intelligence systems, further escalating hostilities. German communications, routed through advanced AI-managed systems, misinterpreted automated Taiwanese instructions as directives from hostile actors. Chaos compounded upon chaos.

In Berlin, economists panicked. The DAX fell sharply as factories that were supposed to produce AI chips for mediation efforts were redirected to military production. Engineers who had been prepping advanced algorithms to stabilize the West Coast AI disruption were reassigned to develop defensive systems along the Baltic Sea.

By the time diplomats and generals realized the absurdity of it all, Germany was simultaneously mediating a global tech conflict in the Pacific, trying to feed its allies in Europe, and defending its borders against Russian offensives. The solution it had envisioned—a rational, technocratic intervention—was impossible in a world ruled by autonomous AI, semi-conductor dominance, naval proxies, and the unpredictable ambitions of global powers.

Chancellor Vogel sighed as he stared at multiple screens showing conflicts spanning half the globe. “We wanted to solve the China-Taiwan problem,” he muttered. “Instead… we’re fighting a war we didn’t even plan for.”

And so, Germany learned the hard way: in a world dominated by AI, semi-conductors, and proxy alliances, no plan survives first contact with reality—and every attempt to stabilize chaos can spiral into even greater conflict.

## Indians Protest The China-Taiwan A.I. Violence By Setting Themselves On Fire. Wall Street Reacts By Leaking Photos Of Them On Fire

The streets of New Delhi were a furnace of outrage. News of the AI-driven chaos sweeping the American West Coast, orchestrated by Taiwanese engineers and Chinese forces, had ignited a movement among Indian activists. They claimed that humanity was losing control over its creations—that autonomous drones, AI surveillance, and semi-conductor wars were eroding human dignity.

The protests escalated quickly. In an extreme demonstration of despair and defiance, some demonstrators began self-immolation—setting themselves on fire in the central plazas of the city. Their screams, their flames, were meant to shock the world, to demand attention to the human cost of AI warfare.

Across the oceans, Wall Street reacted in the most cynical way imaginable. Investment bankers and tech analysts, already obsessed with the volatility of semi-conductor stocks and AI-powered markets, saw opportunity. Photos of the burning protesters, initially leaked by journalists on the ground, were repurposed by financial insiders to create viral media campaigns, manipulate sentiment, and drive stock fluctuations.

“Human suffering drives clicks, clicks drive ad revenue, ad revenue drives the market,” muttered one analyst in a Manhattan office overlooking the river. The tragedy became a commodity, instantly absorbed into trading algorithms and social media feeds. Hedge funds leveraged the unrest to short or pump AI and tech stocks, while financial blogs churned out sensationalized headlines for maximum engagement.

Meanwhile, in India, families watched in horror as their loved ones became not only casualties of their protest but pawns in a global game of profit. The very act meant to highlight the dangers of AI warfare was transformed into fuel for the same system they sought to condemn.

Back in the U.S., regulators debated whether to intervene—but the viral images had already done their damage. Social media algorithms had amplified the tragedy, pushing Wall Street profits higher even as human lives were lost. Analysts whispered darkly about “AI arbitrage,” and news anchors struggled to reconcile morality with market frenzy.

The irony was bitter: Indians sacrificed themselves to protest a world dominated by AI violence, and in doing so, they inadvertently became part of the machinery they were resisting. Humanity burned, both literally and figuratively, while the global financial system cashed in.

And somewhere, in hidden trading rooms and algorithmic servers, the lesson was simple: in the age of AI, even human suffering is a resource—and outrage is just another asset class.

Last but not least, who can forget Commercial Federal Republic America as the real culprit? 

## The Start of the Ending: America’s Robber-Barons

America was crumbling, not from foreign invasion, AI drones, or wars overseas, but from the quiet tyranny of its own rich. The so-called Robber-Barons—wealthy tycoons, tech overlords, and corporate conglomerates—had perfected a new form of domination: surveillance capitalism. Every click, every purchase, every private conversation was tracked, stored, and weaponized.

Middle-class neighborhoods shrank as mortgages were manipulated, foreclosures were engineered, and debts were sold to shadowy financial firms that made billions off human desperation. People lost homes, businesses, and dignity—not because of bad luck, but because the wealthy had decided it was profitable to make them lose.

Worse, crimes were planted on ordinary Americans. Surveillance cameras, hacked devices, and AI algorithms created false evidence, ensuring that those who resisted or questioned the system were crushed under legal machinery. Entire communities were stripped of property, livelihoods, and rights, while the elite watched from penthouses and corporate boardrooms, smiling at their algorithms humming in the background.

The Pentagon, traditionally seen as a protector of freedom, had become complicit. Secret contracts with tech companies, black-budget programs, and AI-driven policing ensured that no ordinary citizen could stand up without being neutralized. The very institutions meant to defend the nation had become instruments of its oppression.

People began to whisper that the wealthy and the Pentagon were mortal enemies—not of foreign nations, but of the citizens themselves. Streets filled with despair, not protest. Nobody wanted to fight for the system anymore; trust had evaporated. Schools, hospitals, and courts were just extensions of a machine that extracted wealth from the powerless and fed it to the powerful.

Journalists who dared to expose the truth were silenced or discredited. Activists disappeared. The middle class, once the backbone of the country, was reduced to fragments, clinging to debt and uncertainty while the Robber-Barons feasted.

It was a new kind of war, a slow-motion apocalypse. Battles weren’t fought with guns or bombs—they were waged through algorithms, data, and relentless economic violence. And the people, having seen the true face of power, understood one thing clearly: they had no army to fight for them, no protector to call on. The country had turned inward on itself, leaving ordinary Americans to face the consequences of a society run entirely for profit.

The Start of the Ending wasn’t marked by a single day of explosions or revolt. It was quiet, insidious, and complete. And as the Robber-Barons tightened their grip, the country understood that their enemies were not invisible strangers—they were the ones who had promised to lead, but only ever led themselves to power.

And it could have just stopped to give room for something else after the Jan-Faggot conspiracy.
